Title: Initial Launch
Date: 2025-04-13

johnj allday website v0.01

The main goal:
-[ ] explore wasm
-[x] frontend/design explorations
-[ ] AI-MCP-server for SSG

This ended up being a Static Site Generator for now.
I wanted to build a website and make it more integrated to my computer.
Hopefully you'll see the progress of this website grow down the line.

If you want the full source code for this static website generator,
I'll post and share the updates via this website, and you'll see how this gets integrated.
