Title: Initial Launch
Date: 2025-04-13

johnj allday website v0.01

The main goal:
-[ ] explore wasm
-[x] frontend/design explorations
-[ ] AI-MCP-server for SSG

This ended up being a Static Site Generator for now.
I wanted to build a website and make it more integrated to my computer.
Hopefully you'll see the progress of this website grow down the line.

What is a Static Site Generator?

A Static Site Generator (SSG) is a tool that converts source content — typically written in Markdown or a similar format — into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Unlike dynamic websites that rely on server-side processing for each request, an SSG pre-builds pages during a build step, allowing them to be served quickly and securely.

Some key advantages of using an SSG include:
- **Performance:** Pre-built files load faster since there's no server-side processing for each page request.
- **Security:** With no dynamic content generation at runtime, the attack surface is significantly reduced.
- **Simplicity:** Write content in Markdown; let the generator handle templating and building.
- **Scalability:** Static assets are easy to cache and can handle large amounts of traffic without heavy backend infrastructure.
- **Maintenance:** Fewer moving parts relative to traditional CMS or dynamic server architectures, simplifying updates and deployments.
